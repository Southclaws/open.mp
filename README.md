The official landing page for the open.mp project.

## Contributing

Read the `CONTRIBUTING.md` document first.

This website is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with no special configuration or
surprises. Simply clone the repo, run `npm install` to grab dependencies and `npm run dev` to start
the development server on http://localhost:3000 then you can edit the source with hot reloading.

Run `npm build` to build a production distribution and `npm run favicon` to generate the favicon if
ever the logo changes.

## Translating

To add a translation:

1. fork the repo
2. create a new branch, the name doesn't matter
3. copy the `./language/English/` directory
4. rename your new directory to the _English_ name of your language
5. add an entry to the map in `./components/languages.js`.

Now you can translate the English text inside `index.mdx` and `faq.mdx`. This file format is
Markdown and is pretty straightforward to understand. Use underscores for italics and
double-asterisks for bold. See [here](https://commonmark.org/help/) for more information on
markdown.

### (Optional) Add Yourself As an "Owner"

If you want to be in charge of maintaining your language, please make a PR to the `CODEOWNERS` file and change `@openmultiplayer/ops` to your GitHub username. This tells GitHub that you have permission to write to this specific directory and notifies other contributors that you're maintaining these files.

### Translation Progress Table

The table below tracks which questions have been translated to which languages. If you see one
missing `[ ]` (because it is new), or outdated `[-]` (because it was changed) in your language,
please submit a new pull request adding it, and update the table below in the pull request as well.
Thank you.

- `[ ]` - not translated.
- `[x]` - translated.
- `[-]` - outdated.
